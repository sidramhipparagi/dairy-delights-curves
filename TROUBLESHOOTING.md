## If Site is Still Blank - Follow These Steps:

### Step 1: HARD REFRESH Your Browser
**This is the most common fix!**

- **Windows**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Clear Cache**: In browser settings, clear all cached images and files

### Step 2: Check DNS Configuration
Your DNS MUST be configured correctly. Verify with your domain registrar:

```bash
# Run this command in terminal to check DNS:
nslookup arihantfood.in
```

**Expected result:** Should show one of these IPs:
- 185.199.108.153
- 185.199.109.153
- 185.199.110.153
- 185.199.111.153

**If DNS is not configured:**
1. Go to your domain registrar (where you bought arihantfood.in)
2. Find DNS settings
3. Add 4 A records with the IPs above
4. Wait 24-48 hours for propagation

### Step 3: Verify GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to: https://github.com/sidramhipparagi/dairy-delights-curves/settings/pages

2. **Check these settings:**
   - Source: **GitHub Actions** ✅
   - Custom domain: **arihantfood.in** ✅
   - DNS check: Should show green checkmark (after DNS propagates)

3. **If custom domain is not set:**
   - Enter `arihantfood.in` in the Custom domain field
   - Click Save
   - Wait a few minutes for DNS verification

### Step 4: Check GitHub Actions Deployment

1. Go to: https://github.com/sidramhipparagi/dairy-delights-curves/actions

2. **Look for latest "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow:**
   - Should have green checkmark ✅
   - If red ❌, click it to see errors
   - Latest deployment should be within last few minutes

3. **If deployment failed:**
   - Click the failed workflow
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Common issues: node modules, build errors

### Step 5: Check Browser Console for Errors

1. **Open Developer Tools:**
   - Press `F12` or right-click → Inspect

2. **Check Console Tab:**
   - Look for red error messages
   - Common errors:
     - `404 Not Found` - file paths wrong
     - `CORS errors` - usually DNS issue
     - JavaScript errors - check logs

3. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Press `F12` → Network tab
   - Refresh page (`F5`)
   - Check these files load successfully (Status 200):
     - `index.html` ✅
     - `index-[hash].js` ✅
     - `index-[hash].css` ✅
     - `logo.png` ✅

### Step 6: Test Different URLs

Try accessing these URLs to narrow down the issue:

1. **https://arihantfood.in** - Main site
2. **https://www.arihantfood.in** - WWW version (if configured)
3. **https://sidramhipparagi.github.io/dairy-delights-curves/** - GitHub Pages URL

**Expected behavior:**
- Option 1 should work (custom domain)
- Option 3 might show blank (configured for custom domain only)

### Step 7: Wait for DNS Propagation

If you **just configured DNS**, it takes time:
- **Minimum**: 1-2 hours
- **Typical**: 6-12 hours
- **Maximum**: 24-48 hours

**Check propagation status:**
- Visit: https://dnschecker.org/#A/arihantfood.in
- Should show GitHub Pages IPs globally

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "This site can't be reached"
**Cause:** DNS not configured or not propagated yet

**Solution:**
1. Verify DNS A records are added
2. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
3. Use https://dnschecker.org to monitor progress

### Issue 2: Blank White Page
**Causes:**
- Browser cache (most common)
- JavaScript not loading
- Wrong base path

**Solutions:**
1. Hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R`)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Try incognito/private window
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue 3: 404 Not Found Page
**Cause:** GitHub Pages not serving files correctly

**Solution:**
1. Check CNAME file exists in repository
2. Verify `.nojekyll` file exists
3. Rebuild and redeploy
4. Check GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"

### Issue 4: Logo Not Showing
**Cause:** Asset path issues

**Solution:**
1. Verify `logo.png` exists in `public/` folder
2. Check browser network tab for 404 errors
3. Assets should load from `https://arihantfood.in/logo.png`

### Issue 5: HTTPS Not Working
**Cause:** SSL certificate not provisioned yet

**Solution:**
1. Wait 10-15 minutes after DNS configures
2. GitHub auto-provisions Let's Encrypt SSL
3. Enable "Enforce HTTPS" in GitHub Pages settings
4. If still fails, remove and re-add custom domain
