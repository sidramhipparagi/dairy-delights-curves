## üîç CRITICAL: Things YOU Must Verify

### Step 1: Check DNS Configuration

**Go to your domain registrar** (where you bought arihantfood.in) and verify these DNS records:

#### A Records (Required)
Add these **4 A records** pointing to GitHub Pages:

```
Type: A
Host: @ (or arihantfood.in)
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A
Host: @ (or arihantfood.in)
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Host: @ (or arihantfood.in)
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Host: @ (or arihantfood.in)
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

#### CNAME Record for www (Optional but Recommended)
```
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Value: sidramhipparagi.github.io
```

**Check DNS Propagation:**
```bash
nslookup arihantfood.in
```

Expected output should show one of the GitHub Pages IPs (185.199.108.153, etc.)

---

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Repository Settings

**CRITICAL:** Go to your repository settings and configure custom domain:

1. **Open:** https://github.com/sidramhipparagi/dairy-delights-curves/settings/pages

2. **Under "Build and deployment":**
   - Source: Should be set to **"GitHub Actions"** ‚úÖ

3. **Under "Custom domain":**
   - Enter: `arihantfood.in`
   - Click **Save**
   - Wait for DNS check to complete (green checkmark)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** If you see a CNAME file warning, this is normal - the file exists in your repo

4. **After DNS propagates (can take up to 48 hours):**
   - Check the box: **"Enforce HTTPS"**

---

### Step 3: Monitor GitHub Actions Deployment

1. **Go to Actions tab:** https://github.com/sidramhipparagi/dairy-delights-curves/actions

2. **Check latest workflow run:**
   - Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Status should be green ‚úÖ
   - If red ‚ùå, click to see error logs

3. **Workflow should run automatically** when you push to main branch

---

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

After DNS propagates and GitHub Actions completes:

1. **Open:** https://arihantfood.in
2. **Hard refresh:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. **Check browser console:** Press `F12` and look for any errors in Console tab

#### If Still Blank:

**Check Browser Console for errors:**
- Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
- Go to **Console** tab
- Look for any red errors
- Take a screenshot and share if you see errors

**Check Network tab:**
- Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
- Go to **Network** tab
- Refresh the page
- Check if `index.html` loads (should be 200 status)
- Check if JavaScript files load (should be 200 status)
- Look for any 404 errors (files not found)

---

## üîß Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Domain's DNS record could not be retrieved"
**Solution:** 
- DNS not configured or still propagating
- Check DNS settings with your domain registrar
- Wait 24-48 hours for full propagation
- Use https://dnschecker.org/ to check propagation status

### Issue 2: Blank Page After Deployment
**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Already fixed: Removed basename from router
2. ‚úÖ Already fixed: Set base to '/' in vite config
3. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
4. Clear browser cache
5. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
6. Wait for DNS to fully propagate

### Issue 3: Works on github.io but not on custom domain
**Solution:**
- Ensure GitHub Pages custom domain is set to `arihantfood.in`
- Verify CNAME file exists in deployed site (check in Actions artifacts)
- DNS must be properly configured

### Issue 4: GitHub Actions Failing
**Solution:**
- Check Actions tab for error details
- Ensure `npm ci` can install all dependencies
- Ensure `npm run build` succeeds locally
- Check workflow has proper permissions

## üöÄ Testing Locally

To test the production build locally before deploying:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

Then open: http://localhost:4173

---

## üìû Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATELY:** Go to https://github.com/sidramhipparagi/dairy-delights-curves/settings/pages
   - Set custom domain to: `arihantfood.in`
   - Set source to: "GitHub Actions"

2. **Configure DNS** at your domain registrar with the A records listed above

3. **Wait for DNS propagation** (can take 24-48 hours)

4. **Check deployment status** in GitHub Actions tab

5. **Test site** at https://arihantfood.in after DNS propagates

---

## üîç Verification Commands

Run these commands to check configuration:

```bash
# Check DNS A records
nslookup arihantfood.in

# Check DNS from multiple locations
# Visit: https://dnschecker.org/#A/arihantfood.in

# Check CNAME (if configured www)
nslookup www.arihantfood.in

# Test if site responds
curl -I https://arihantfood.in
```

## üìù File Summary

**Files created/modified for GitHub Pages:**

```
.github/workflows/deploy.yml    ‚Üê GitHub Actions workflow
public/CNAME                    ‚Üê Custom domain configuration
public/.nojekyll               ‚Üê Prevent Jekyll processing
public/404.html                 ‚Üê SPA routing for direct URLs
index.html                      ‚Üê Enhanced with SPA routing scripts
src/App.tsx                     ‚Üê Removed basename from router
vite.config.ts                  ‚Üê Set base to '/' for custom domain
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **First deployment:** DNS changes take 24-48 hours to propagate globally
2. **HTTPS:** GitHub automatically provisions SSL certificate after DNS is configured (takes a few minutes)
3. **CNAME file:** GitHub Pages might reset it - if so, re-add in settings
4. **Cache:** Always hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R`) when testing
5. **www redirect:** If you configure www CNAME, both www and non-www will work

## üÜò If Still Having Issues

Please provide:
1. Screenshot of GitHub Pages settings page
2. Screenshot of browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
3. Screenshot of browser network tab showing failed requests
4. Output of: `nslookup arihantfood.in`
5. Screenshot of your domain's DNS settings

This will help diagnose the exact issue.
